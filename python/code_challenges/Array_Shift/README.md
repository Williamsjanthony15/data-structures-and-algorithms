## code Challenge 2

Code Challenge 2 was white board, the white board is requiring an array taken as an input and output the array but with the given number inserted in the middle.

I worked on this with Kevin Henry

The image is of the Whiteboard along with the code. The code was initally written on Repl. where it was also verfied for functionality.
